# Goal 01 — Python Neo4j Checkpointer (v0.0.0)

**Status:** 🟢 Complete + Released
**Started:** 2026-03-26
**Completed:** 2026-03-26
**Released:** 2026-03-26 — [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/langgraph-checkpoint-neo4j/0.0.0/) · [GitHub Release](https://github.com/l4b4r4b4b4/langgraph-checkpoint-neo4j/releases/tag/python-v0.0.0)
**Priority:** P0 — Core deliverable

---

## Objective

Implement a Neo4j-backed checkpointer for LangGraph in Python that is a drop-in replacement for the official Postgres checkpointer. Must pass the upstream conformance test suite and provide both sync (`Neo4jSaver`) and async (`AsyncNeo4jSaver`) variants.

## Success Criteria

- [x] `Neo4jSaver` implements all required `BaseCheckpointSaver` methods (sync)
- [x] `AsyncNeo4jSaver` implements all required `BaseCheckpointSaver` methods (async)
- [x] Passes all **base** conformance tests: `put`, `put_writes`, `get_tuple`, `list`, `delete_thread` — **59/59 tests, FULL (5/5)**
- [x] `setup()` creates Neo4j schema (indexes, constraints) and is idempotent
- [x] `from_conn_string()` factory method works like the Postgres equivalent
- [x] Context manager protocol (`with` / `async with`) for resource cleanup
- [x] Thread-safe — sync variant uses `threading.Lock`
- [x] Published to PyPI as `langgraph-checkpoint-neo4j` v0.0.0
- [x] README with working quick-start examples

## Architecture Decisions

### AD-01: Neo4j Data Model

The Postgres checkpointer uses 3 tables + 1 migrations table. We translate to Neo4j nodes:

| Postgres Table | Neo4j Node Label | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|
| `checkpoints` | `Checkpoint` | `thread_id`, `checkpoint_ns`, `checkpoint_id`, `parent_checkpoint_id`, `checkpoint` (JSON), `metadata` (JSON) |
| `checkpoint_blobs` | `CheckpointBlob` | `thread_id`, `checkpoint_ns`, `channel`, `version`, `type`, `blob` (bytes) |
| `checkpoint_writes` | `CheckpointWrite` | `thread_id`, `checkpoint_ns`, `checkpoint_id`, `task_id`, `task_path`, `idx`, `channel`, `type`, `blob` (bytes) |
| `checkpoint_migrations` | `CheckpointMigration` | `v` (integer) |

**Why nodes, not relationships?** The Postgres model is essentially 3 independent tables joined by compound keys (`thread_id`, `checkpoint_ns`, etc.). In Neo4j, using nodes with indexed properties gives us the same query patterns without adding relationship overhead. We can always add relationships later if graph traversal queries become valuable.

**Why not use a graph-native model?** Tempting to use `(Thread)-[:HAS_CHECKPOINT]->(Checkpoint)-[:HAS_BLOB]->(Blob)` but that deviates from the Postgres model's semantics and makes conformance harder. Start flat (node-per-table), optimize later.

### AD-02: Serialization — Reuse LangGraph's SerDe (with important distinction)

The `BaseCheckpointSaver` provides `self.serde` for serializing channel values and writes. We use:
- **`json.dumps()` / `json.loads()`** for checkpoint and metadata dicts (stored as JSON strings in Neo4j)
- **`serde.dumps_typed()` / `serde.loads_typed()`** for channel blob values and write blobs only

This is important: the Postgres checkpointer uses native JSONB for checkpoint/metadata (via `Jsonb()` adapter), but for Neo4j we store them as plain JSON strings. Using `serde.dumps_typed()` for these would produce msgpack bytes, which are not human-readable and caused the `'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x88` error during initial development.

### AD-03: Connection Management

- **Python `neo4j` driver** provides `neo4j.Driver` (connection pool) and `neo4j.Session` / `neo4j.AsyncSession`
- Constructor accepts a `neo4j.Driver` or `neo4j.AsyncDriver`
- `from_conn_string()` creates a driver internally, owns its lifecycle
- Context manager closes the driver on exit (only if we created it via `_owns_driver` flag)

### AD-04: Transactions

- All operations use auto-commit sessions (not explicit transactions)
- Each session context (`with driver.session()`) handles a single logical operation
- Neo4j's `MERGE` statements provide atomic upsert behaviour

### AD-05: Conformance Testing Strategy

The upstream `langgraph-checkpoint-conformance` package provides a decorator-based test framework. We:

1. Install it as a dev dependency (`>=0.0.1`)
2. Register our `AsyncNeo4jSaver` with `@checkpointer_test`
3. Run `validate()` in a pytest test
4. Lifespan verifies Neo4j connectivity once before the suite
5. Factory cleans up all checkpoint nodes before/after each capability suite

### AD-06: Version Type Consistency

Neo4j is type-strict: `1` (integer) != `"1"` (string). Channel versions from the checkpoint dict come in as integers from JSON, but blob nodes must store them as strings. We use `str(version)` (not `cast(str, version)`) in `_dump_blobs` to ensure actual string conversion. This was a critical bug fix during development.

## High-Level Plan (All Goals)

| Phase | Goal | Description | Status |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | **Goal 01: Python Checkpointer** | Sync + async Neo4j savers, conformance tests | 🟢 Complete |
| 2 | **Goal 02: TypeScript Checkpointer** | Port to TS using `neo4j-driver`, npm publish | ⚪ Not Started |
| 3 | **Goal 03: Publishing Pipeline** | GitHub Actions for automated PyPI + npm releases | ⚪ Not Started |

---

## Task Breakdown (Goal 01)

### Task 01: Project Skeleton & Test Harness 🟢
**Objective:** Get `packages/python` to a state where `uv run pytest` runs (even if 0 tests pass).

- ✅ Implicit namespace packages (removed `langgraph/__init__.py` and `langgraph/checkpoint/__init__.py`)
- ✅ Created `py.typed` marker
- ✅ Wired up `conftest.py` with Neo4j driver fixtures (sync + async) and env var overrides
- ✅ Wired up conformance test registration (`@checkpointer_test`) with lifespan + cleanup
- ✅ Created stub `Neo4jSaver` and `AsyncNeo4jSaver` (all methods raise `NotImplementedError`)
- ✅ `uv sync` works, `uv run pytest` collects and runs conformance tests
- ✅ All 5 base capabilities correctly detected; all 59 tests fail with `NotImplementedError` (expected)
- ✅ `ruff check` and `ruff format` pass cleanly
- ✅ Fixed conformance dep version constraint (`>=0.0.1` — only version on PyPI)
- ✅ Enabled setuptools namespace package discovery (`namespaces = true`)

**See:** `Task-01-Project-Skeleton/scratchpad.md` for full implementation details.

**Files created:**
- `packages/python/src/langgraph/checkpoint/neo4j/__init__.py` (stub Neo4jSaver)
- `packages/python/src/langgraph/checkpoint/neo4j/aio.py` (stub AsyncNeo4jSaver)
- `packages/python/src/langgraph/checkpoint/neo4j/py.typed`
- `packages/python/tests/__init__.py`
- `packages/python/tests/conftest.py`
- `packages/python/tests/test_conformance.py`

**Files removed** (namespace collision fix):
- `packages/python/src/langgraph/__init__.py`
- `packages/python/src/langgraph/checkpoint/__init__.py`

### Task 02: Neo4j Schema & Setup 🟢
**Objective:** Implement `setup()` — create indexes/constraints in Neo4j, track migrations.

Combined with Tasks 03-05 into a single implementation push (see below).

- ✅ Designed 4-version migration list with Cypher DDL
- ✅ v0: `CheckpointMigration` uniqueness constraint
- ✅ v1: `Checkpoint` composite uniqueness + thread_id index
- ✅ v2: `CheckpointBlob` composite uniqueness + thread_id index
- ✅ v3: `CheckpointWrite` composite uniqueness + thread_id index
- ✅ `setup()` is idempotent — safe to call multiple times
- ✅ Migration tracking via `CheckpointMigration` nodes

### Task 03: Implement `put()` and `get_tuple()` 🟢
**Objective:** Core checkpoint storage and retrieval.

Combined with Tasks 02, 04, 05 — all implemented together.

- ✅ `put()` / `aput()` — stores checkpoint JSON + metadata JSON + channel blobs
- ✅ `get_tuple()` / `aget_tuple()` — retrieves checkpoint + joins blobs + writes
- ✅ Channel values stored as `CheckpointBlob` nodes via `serde.dumps_typed()`
- ✅ Checkpoint/metadata stored as JSON strings via `json.dumps()`
- ✅ Incremental channel updates work (only new_versions blobs are written)
- ✅ Parent checkpoint tracking via `parent_checkpoint_id`
- ✅ Pending sends migration (TASKS channel from parent checkpoint)

### Task 04: Implement `put_writes()`, `list()`, `delete_thread()` 🟢
**Objective:** Complete the remaining base capabilities.

Combined with Tasks 02, 03, 05.

- ✅ `put_writes()` / `aput_writes()` — MERGE writes with UPSERT/INSERT semantics
- ✅ `list()` / `alist()` — dynamic Cypher WHERE + metadata post-filtering in Python
- ✅ `delete_thread()` / `adelete_thread()` — DETACH DELETE all nodes for thread_id
- ✅ All 5 base conformance test suites pass

### Task 05: Async Variant (`AsyncNeo4jSaver`) 🟢
**Objective:** Implement the async version using `neo4j.AsyncDriver`.

Implemented simultaneously with the sync variant.

- ✅ `AsyncNeo4jSaver` with native async methods
- ✅ Uses `neo4j.AsyncDriver` / `neo4j.AsyncGraphDatabase`
- ✅ Registered with `@checkpointer_test` conformance suite
- ✅ All 59 conformance tests pass

### Task 06: Connection Management & Polish 🟢
**Objective:** Production-ready connection handling, error messages, packaging.

- ✅ `from_conn_string()` factory (sync and async) — context manager, owns driver lifecycle
- ✅ Context manager protocol (`__enter__`/`__exit__`, `__aenter__`/`__aexit__`)
- ✅ `get_next_version()` — same algorithm as Postgres (integer-major + random-fractional)
- ✅ Docstrings for all public APIs (classes, methods, module-level)
- ✅ `packages/python/README.md` with quick-start, API reference, data model docs
- ✅ `uv build` produces a valid wheel (4 files: `__init__.py`, `aio.py`, `base.py`, `py.typed`)
- ✅ `ruff check` + `ruff format` pass cleanly

## Implementation Notes

### Module Structure

```
packages/python/src/langgraph/checkpoint/neo4j/
├── __init__.py   # Neo4jSaver (sync) — public API
├── aio.py        # AsyncNeo4jSaver (async) — public API
├── base.py       # BaseNeo4jSaver + Cypher queries + migrations + serialization helpers
└── py.typed      # PEP 561 marker
```

### Key Design Choices Made During Implementation

1. **Combined Tasks 02-05** — The conformance tests require all methods to work together
   (put+get_tuple are tested as pairs). Implementing them separately with no test feedback
   would have been blind. All four tasks were implemented in a single push.

2. **Shared `base.py`** — Mirrors `langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.base`. Contains:
   - `MIGRATIONS` list (Cypher DDL per version)
   - All Cypher query strings (UPSERT, SELECT, DELETE)
   - `BaseNeo4jSaver` with `_dump_blobs`, `_load_blobs`, `_dump_writes`, `_load_writes`,
     `_migrate_pending_sends`, `get_next_version`, `_build_list_query`
   - Both `Neo4jSaver` and `AsyncNeo4jSaver` inherit from `BaseNeo4jSaver`

3. **JSON for checkpoint/metadata, serde for blobs** — The Postgres checkpointer uses native
   JSONB for checkpoint+metadata but `serde.dumps_typed()` for blob values. We replicate this
   by using `json.dumps()` for checkpoint/metadata and `serde.dumps_typed()` for blobs.

4. **Metadata post-filtering** — Neo4j doesn't have Postgres's `@>` JSON containment operator.
   The `list()` method filters by `thread_id`, `checkpoint_ns`, `checkpoint_id`, and `before`
   in Cypher, but applies metadata key/value filters in Python after fetching results.

5. **Version as string** — All blob versions are stored as strings (`str(version)`) in Neo4j
   to avoid int/string type mismatches during lookups.

### Conformance Test Results

---

## Post-Completion Progress (Latest Session)

### Latest Local Demo Work

After Goal 01 was functionally complete, additional local testing work was done to validate real-world usage patterns and prepare for release.

#### Demo 1: `examples/simple_agent.py`
A low-level LangGraph demo was created using `StateGraph` directly with this package's `Neo4jSaver`.

**Purpose:**
- deterministic local persistence smoke test
- executable-cell testing for Zed / Python runtime integration
- no external LLM provider dependency
- sync + async usage examples in one file

**What it demonstrates:**
- sync `Neo4jSaver` flow
- async `AsyncNeo4jSaver` flow
- thread persistence across multiple invocations
- checkpoint history inspection
- time-travel to an older checkpoint
- persistence proof via closing one saver and reopening another
- cleanup with `delete_thread()`

**Result:**
- runs successfully end-to-end against local Neo4j
- confirmed:
  - `setup()` works
  - checkpoints are created on each super-step
  - state is restored across saver instances
  - history listing works
  - time travel works
  - thread deletion works

#### Demo 2: `examples/create_agent_neo4j.py`
A second demo was created using the latest LangChain v1 API: `langchain.agents.create_agent`.

**Why this matters:**
- current docs recommend `create_agent`
- `create_react_agent` is deprecated
- this is the correct release-smoke-test direction for a modern user workflow

**Important findings from docs review:**
- `create_agent` is built on LangGraph
- `checkpointer` is a first-class argument on `create_agent`
- persistence still relies on:
  - `config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "..."}}`

**Current state of this demo:**
- file created
- imports and API usage align with current LangChain v1 direction
- supports provider selection via environment variables:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- currently fails fast with a clear error if no provider API key is configured
- not yet validated end-to-end with a real provider in this repo session because no provider key was available

### Docs / Research Notes

The latest official docs were consulted after the initial hand-rolled graph demo.

**Key doc conclusions:**
- `create_agent` is the standard LangChain v1 agent API
- `create_react_agent` is deprecated
- high-level persistence APIs include:
  - `agent.get_state(config)`
  - `agent.get_state_history(config)`
- low-level `StateGraph` usage remains valid, but is no longer the preferred user-facing agent entrypoint

### Package / Dependency Updates

The Python package dev environment was updated with latest agent-facing dependencies for local testing:

- `langchain`
- `langchain-openai`
- `langchain-anthropic`

Installed during the session:
- `langchain==1.2.13`
- `langgraph==1.1.3`
- `langchain-openai==1.1.12`
- `langchain-anthropic==1.4.0`

These were added as **dev dependencies for local testing/examples**, not core runtime dependencies for the library itself.

### Local Testing Notes

#### Verified locally
- `tests/test_conformance.py` passes
- all 59 conformance tests pass
- `examples/simple_agent.py` runs successfully with local Neo4j
- `uv build` succeeds and produces valid source + wheel artifacts

#### Not yet verified in-session
- `examples/create_agent_neo4j.py` with a real provider key
- end-to-end latest-API `create_agent` memory recall with OpenAI or Anthropic

### Release / Publish Notes

#### Versioning
There is an important project-rule conflict to keep in mind:

- repository rules say the **first version must be `0.0.1`**
- the user mentioned trying a `v0.0.0` release

**Recommendation:** release `0.0.1`, not `0.0.0`, unless the user explicitly overrides the project rule.

#### Release blockers before publishing
These are the main blockers / caveats still outstanding:

1. **Run `examples/create_agent_neo4j.py` with a real provider key**
   - ideally test with `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - confirm latest API path works with persistence

2. **Resolve example lint policy**
   - the repo lint config flags `print()` globally (`T201`)
   - interactive examples intentionally use `print()`
   - options:
     - exclude `examples/` from this rule
     - add per-file ignores
     - accept examples as intentionally non-lint-clean
   - this is a repo-quality issue, not a library correctness issue

3. **PyPI metadata review**
   - package README now exists at `packages/python/README.md`
   - `uv build` succeeds
   - still worth checking:
     - license metadata format
     - final package description
     - homepage/repository URLs
     - long description rendering on PyPI

4. **Potential polish**
   - graceful connection failure messages are still listed as a future improvement
   - performance optimization for `_build_checkpoint_tuple()` remains future work

### Suggested Next Steps for Future Session

1. Set a real provider key:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

2. Run:
   - `uv run python examples/create_agent_neo4j.py`

3. If that passes:
   - decide whether to keep `examples/` linted or exempt from `T201`
   - review `pyproject.toml` metadata and README rendering
   - publish the Python package

4. Recommended publish target:
   - `0.0.1`

### Practical Commands for Next Session

From `packages/python/`:

```bash
# With OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
export NEO4J_PASSWORD=...

uv run python examples/create_agent_neo4j.py
```

```bash
# With Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5
export NEO4J_PASSWORD=...

uv run python examples/create_agent_neo4j.py
```

```bash
# Build
uv build
```

```bash
# Publish (recommended version: 0.0.1)
uv publish
```

## Final Stabilization Session (2026-03-26)

### What Was Done

#### 1. CI Coverage Configuration Fixed 🟢

**Root cause:** Python coverage in CI was reporting `0%` because the coverage
source target in `packages/python/pyproject.toml` used a slash-delimited path
(`langgraph/checkpoint/neo4j`) instead of the importable package name
(`langgraph.checkpoint.neo4j`).

**Fix:**
- Changed `[tool.coverage.run].source` from
  `["langgraph/checkpoint/neo4j"]` to
  `["langgraph.checkpoint.neo4j"]`
- Coverage collection now works correctly in both local runs and CI

**Result:** coverage is now real and enforceable instead of silently broken.

#### 2. Python Coverage Threshold Raised to 72% and Exceeded 🟢

**Requirement:** coverage should be at least **72%**.

**Fixes applied:**
- Updated CI Python test command to use `--cov-fail-under=72`
- Added a new sync integration/smoke test file:
  - `packages/python/tests/test_sync_saver.py`

**Coverage result after test additions:**
- Total coverage: **87.75%**
- Threshold: **72%**
- Status: **passing**

This is materially better than lowering the threshold or disabling coverage:
the new coverage comes from meaningful sync-path integration tests, not test
padding.

#### 3. Added Sync Saver Integration Tests 🟢

Created `packages/python/tests/test_sync_saver.py` to cover synchronous code
paths that the async conformance suite does not exercise well enough.

Covered behaviors:
- `Neo4jSaver.setup()` idempotency
- `put()`
- `get_tuple()`
- `list()`
- metadata filtering
- `before` filtering
- `limit`
- `put_writes()`
- `delete_thread()`
- missing-thread lookup returns `None`

This substantially improved coverage for:
- `src/langgraph/checkpoint/neo4j/__init__.py`
- shared sync data handling paths
- list/filter/delete semantics in the sync saver

#### 4. TypeScript Package Bootstrap for CI Stability 🟢

**Problem:** CI was failing in TypeScript jobs because `packages/ts/` existed
but had no actual package scaffold. Local hooks did not catch this because no
`.ts` files were part of the pushed diff, while CI saw the package directory as
new/changed and attempted full-package checks.

**Fix:** Added a minimal TS package bootstrap:
- `packages/ts/package.json`
- `packages/ts/tsconfig.json`
- `packages/ts/src/index.ts`

This is intentionally a placeholder package:
- version `0.0.0`
- marked `private: true`
- no real implementation yet
- enough structure for `bun install`, `bunx tsc --noEmit`, and CI job setup to
  behave deterministically

#### 5. Lefthook Pre-Push Behavior Aligned with Desired Workflow 🟢

The pre-push hook was refined toward the same philosophy used in the reference
repo:

- `piped: true` fail-fast execution
- cheap checks first, expensive checks last
- full-package checks instead of diff-only quality gates for pre-push
- local Python integration tests source `.env.local` when present

Current pre-push order:
1. no merge commits
2. Python lint + format check
3. TS type check
4. Python tests
5. TS tests

This is important because it makes local push behavior much closer to CI
behavior and prevents expensive test runs when lint/typecheck already fail.

#### 6. Local Test Defaults Now Match docker-compose Ports 🟢

The local Docker Compose setup exposes Neo4j Bolt on `7387`, but test defaults
originally assumed `7687`.

Updated test defaults in:
- `packages/python/tests/conftest.py`
- `packages/python/tests/test_conformance.py`

New local default:
- `bolt://localhost:7387`

CI still overrides this explicitly with environment variables for service
containers, so local and CI behavior are both correct.

#### 7. CI Workflow Stabilization 🟢

Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
- PRs target `feature` and `main`
- Python coverage threshold set to `72`
- Bun install uses `--frozen-lockfile`
- existing Neo4j service-container flow kept intact for Python integration tests

#### 8. Release / Branch Workflow Status 🟢

Current release workflow state:

- `release/python-v0.0.0` branch created and pushed
- PR created:
  - `release/python-v0.0.0` → `feature`
- `feature` branch exists
- branch protection ruleset JSON files exist for:
  - `.github/rulesets/feature.json`
  - `.github/rulesets/main.json`
- release workflow exists:
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- PyPI trusted publisher was configured by the user

### Current Quality Snapshot

#### Python
- Conformance suite: ✅ passes
- Sync integration tests: ✅ pass
- Coverage: ✅ **87.75%**
- Ruff lint/format: ✅ pass
- Neo4j planner warnings: ✅ fixed

#### TypeScript
- Minimal CI bootstrap package: ✅ in place
- Real implementation: ⚪ not started
- Real parity tests: ⚪ not started

### Important Lessons / Notes

1. **Hooks did not catch TS CI failure earlier** because local hook execution
   skipped TS commands when no matching `.ts` files were part of the push,
   while CI evaluated the whole package directory as changed. This has now been
   reduced by making the TS package scaffold real enough for deterministic CI.

2. **Coverage was not “low” at first — it was broken.**
   The first issue was misconfigured coverage collection (`0%` due to wrong
   source target). After fixing coverage collection, the true number was
   ~60%, which was then raised meaningfully to ~88% by adding sync tests.

3. **`0.0.0` is correctly being used as environment/release-pipeline
   stabilization**, not as proof of final feature parity.

---

## v0.0.0 Release Session (2026-03-26) 🟢

### What Was Done

#### 1. Fixed CI: TypeScript Lint Failure 🟢

**Root cause:** The `lint-ts` CI job ran because root-level files changed
(triggering the `root` change-detection filter). The job executed
`bunx tsc --noEmit`, but `typescript` was not listed as a dependency anywhere
— not in `packages/ts/package.json` devDependencies, not in the root
`package.json`.

**Fix:**
- Added `typescript` (`^5.7.0`) as devDependency to `packages/ts/package.json`
- Regenerated `bun.lock` to include TS workspace and `typescript@5.9.3`
- Commit: `fix(ci): add typescript devDep to TS bootstrap package`

#### 2. Fixed CI: TypeScript Test Failure 🟢

**Root cause:** CI ran `bun test` (bare Bun test runner), which exits with
code 1 when no test files are found. The TS package has no tests yet — it's
a bootstrap placeholder.

**Fix:**
- Changed CI workflow to use `bun run test` instead of `bun test`, which
  delegates to the `package.json` `test` script (placeholder echo)
- Also updated root `package.json` `test:ts` script for consistency
- Commit: `fix(ci): use 'bun run test' instead of bare 'bun test' for TS`

#### 3. PR Merge Chain Completed 🟢

Merge flow executed successfully:
1. `release/python-v0.0.0` → `feature` (PR #1) — merged with all CI green
2. `feature` → `main` (PR #2) — merged
3. Deleted remote branches: `feature`, `release/python-v0.0.0`
4. Cleaned up local stale branches
5. Rebased local `main` to latest `origin/main`

#### 4. Tag + Release + PyPI Publish 🟢

- Tagged: `git tag python-v0.0.0 main && git push origin python-v0.0.0`
- `release.yml` triggered automatically on tag push
- **PyPI publish succeeded** via OIDC trusted publisher (`pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`)
- **GitHub Release created** automatically by `softprops/action-gh-release`
- Package live at: https://pypi.org/project/langgraph-checkpoint-neo4j/0.0.0/
- Release at: https://github.com/l4b4r4b4b4/langgraph-checkpoint-neo4j/releases/tag/python-v0.0.0

## What's Next: Goal 02 — Upstream Parity Testing (v0.0.1)

The v0.0.0 release validates that the environment, CI, and release pipeline
work end-to-end. The checkpointer passes the official conformance suite
(59/59 tests), but conformance tests are **necessary, not sufficient** for
production confidence.

The next milestone (`v0.0.1`) should be driven by **upstream parity testing**:

1. **Adapt upstream checkpoint-postgres tests** from
   `vendor/langgraph-py/libs/checkpoint-postgres/tests/` to use Neo4j fixtures
2. **Run them alongside conformance tests** to find subtle semantic differences
3. **Fix any failures** discovered by the parity suite
4. **Gate v0.0.1 release** on both conformance + parity suite passing

This is tracked as **Goal 02** in the goals index.

### Key files to study

- `vendor/langgraph-py/libs/checkpoint-postgres/tests/` — upstream test suite
- `packages/python/tests/conftest.py` — existing Neo4j fixtures
- `packages/python/tests/test_conformance.py` — existing conformance wrapper

### Other items for future sessions

- Apply GitHub branch protections in UI (rulesets exist in-repo but need
  confirmation in Settings → Rulesets)
- Run `examples/create_agent_neo4j.py` with a real provider key
- Consider performance improvements (batched Cypher in `_build_checkpoint_tuple`)
- Extended capabilities: `copy_thread`, `delete_for_runs`, `prune`


## Release Prep Session (2026-03-26)

### What Was Done

#### 1. Fixed Neo4j Planner Warnings 🟢

**Root cause:** The Neo4j query planner emits "property key does not exist"
notifications when a `MATCH`/`RETURN` references property keys that have never
been set on any node in the database. This happened on cold starts — the very
first `get_tuple()` call ran `GET_LATEST_CHECKPOINT_CYPHER` before any `put()`
had created a `Checkpoint` node, so property keys like `parent_checkpoint_id`,
`checkpoint`, and `metadata` were unknown to the schema catalog.

**Fix:** Added migration **v4** in `base.py` that eagerly registers all
property keys by creating (then immediately deleting) a temporary
`_PropertyKeyInit` node with every property the checkpointer uses. This is
cheap, idempotent, and runs during `setup()`.

- File changed: `packages/python/src/langgraph/checkpoint/neo4j/base.py`
- Migration creates a dummy node with all 14 property keys, then deletes it
- Verified: `simple_agent.py` runs with zero planner warnings
- Verified: conformance tests still pass (1 pytest test → 59 internal checks)

#### 2. Fixed Async `alist` LIMIT Bug 🟢

**Bug:** `AsyncNeo4jSaver.alist()` applied `LIMIT` in Cypher even when a
metadata `filter` was set. Since metadata filtering is done post-query in
Python, applying `LIMIT` in Cypher could cause the method to return fewer
results than requested when some rows are filtered out.

The sync `Neo4jSaver.list()` already had the correct guard:
`if limit is not None and not filter`.

**Fix:** Changed `aio.py` line 249 to match the sync behavior:
`if limit is not None and not filter:`.

- File changed: `packages/python/src/langgraph/checkpoint/neo4j/aio.py`

#### 3. Fixed Lint Policy for Examples (T201) 🟢

**Problem:** Ruff `T201` rule flags `print()` statements. Examples
intentionally use `print()` for demo output, causing lint failures.

**Fix:** Added `per-file-ignores` in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
"examples/**/*.py" = ["T201"]
```

- File changed: `packages/python/pyproject.toml`
- `ruff check .` now passes clean

#### 4. Fixed License Metadata (setuptools deprecation) 🟢

**Problem:** `uv build` emitted setuptools deprecation warnings about
`project.license` table format and license classifiers.

**Fix:**
- Changed `license = { text = "MIT" }` → `license = "MIT"` (SPDX string)
- Removed deprecated `"License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License"` classifier
- File changed: `packages/python/pyproject.toml`
- `uv build` now produces zero warnings

#### 5. Created Repo-Level LICENSE File 🟢

- Created: `LICENSE` (MIT, matching pyproject.toml declaration)
- Previously missing from the repository root

### Verification Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `ruff check .` | ✅ All checks passed |
| `ruff format --check .` | ✅ 8 files already formatted |
| `pytest tests/test_conformance.py -v` | ✅ 1 passed (59 internal checks) |
| `examples/simple_agent.py` | ✅ Sync + Async + Persistence proof — no warnings |
| `uv build` | ✅ Clean — sdist + wheel at 0.0.1, zero deprecation warnings |
